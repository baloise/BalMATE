# Charter

## Motivation
If we consider a topic to be important and of global interest, we elaborate the topic within a working group.

## Culture
 - Within working groups the [collegiality principle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollegialit%C3%A4tsprinzip) is applied.
 - The results of a working group are usually final and binding. Veto rights deviating from this can be defined by the lead committee. The lead committee evaluates the decisions.
 - We make our decisions consciously and comprehensibly.  
 - Working group decisions and their evaluation by the lead organization are openly communicated (at least in CCs and in the IT minutes).
 - For participants, the principle of "can I contribute something essential to the WG" applies. Pure interest in the topic is no legitimation to participate in a WG.
 - Each WG participant brings the required time.

## Organizational structure
 - A working group is assigned to a lead organization (CC, management, etc.).
 - The working group has
   - A lead organization (e.g. a CC)
   - A working group lead (one person)
   - 2-10 additional participants, ideally from 2 or more domains and if appropriate from multiple lead organizations
   - A specific, articulated goal
   - a planned end date
 - The working group lead makes the final decision on the composition of the working group.

## Process organization
 - Each working group maintains a Confluence page on which the lead, goal / task, dates, participants, (interim) results, decisions and evaluations of the lead committee are logged. 
- Workgroups have the status **planned** (with start date), **active** (with end date) and **closed**. The status can be seen on the Confluence page.
- 1-2 weeks before the start of a working group, it will be published in the next [IT management protocol](https://confluence.baloisenet.com/atlassian/x/WYHbLw). Interested parties (including non-TAM members) can then contact the lead. 
- In principle, the majority principle (absolute majority) applies to decisions, whereby the lead has the right of the casting vote. In justified cases, this mode can be deviated from.
- If there is a need for escalation, the CCO is the first point of contact.
- At the end of a working group, the result is presented to and evaluated by the lead committee.
- The result and the evaluation of the lead committee are published in the following management protocol.
