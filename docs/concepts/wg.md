# Lifecycle

Working groups follow where applicable this life-cycle which is primarily based on and derived from
- our [oneIT core processes](https://confluence.baloisenet.com/atlassian/x/VI7gcg) 
- as well as SAFe best practices such as the "[lean startup cycle](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/epic/)"

# Charter

## Motivation
If we consider a topic to be important and of global interest, we elaborate the topic within a working group.

## Culture
 - Within working groups the [collegiality principle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollegialit%C3%A4tsprinzip) is applied.
 - The results of a working group are usually final and binding. Veto rights deviating from this can be defined by the core member. The core and review member evaluate the decisions.
 - We make our decisions consciously and comprehensibly.  
 - Working group decisions and their evaluation by the lead organization are openly communicated (at least e.g. in CoPs and the IT management protocol).
 - For participants, the principle of "can I contribute something essential to the WG" applies. Pure interest in the topic is no legitimation to participate in a WG.
 - Each WG member brings the required time.

## Organizational structure
 - A working group is assigned to a lead organization (CoP, enterprise architecture, management, etc.).
 - The working group has
   - a lead organization (e.g. a CoP)
   - a working group lead (one person)
   - 2-10 additional member, ideally from 2 or more domains and if appropriate from multiple other teams or CoPs
   - a specific, articulated goal
   - a planned start and end date
 - The working group lead makes the final decision on the composition of the working group.

## Process organization
 - Each working group maintains a Confluence page on which the lead, sponsor, goal / task, dates, member, (interim) results, decisions and evaluations of the core member are logged. 
- Workgroups have the status **planned** (with start date), **active** (with end date) and **closed**. The status can be seen on the Confluence page.
- Before the start of a working group, it will be published in the next [IT management protocol](https://confluence.baloisenet.com/atlassian/x/WYHbLw).
- In principle, the majority principle ([absolute majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority)) applies to decisions, whereby the lead has the right of the casting vote. In justified cases, this mode can be deviated from.
- If there is a need for escalation, the BalMATE Team is the first point of contact.
- At the end of a working group, the result is presented to and evaluated by the e.g. reviewing member.
- The result and the evaluation are published in the following management protocol.
